# First App

### Introduction to activity lifecycle, ressources and link xml and Kotlin code

The goal of this first session is to get familiar with Android basics : **Resources**, **Views** and **Activity Lifecycle**.

It also allowed me to develop in **Kotlin** for the first time and to appreciate what the **functional paradigm** can bring to Android development. This point will be much more discussed in the second session for which I had to build a more thorough application using many **lambda** where there would have been abstract classes in Java.
